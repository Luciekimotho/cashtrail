## üåê Deployment

This application is optimized for deployment on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), which offers a seamless and free hosting experience for modern web applications.

To deploy your own version of CashTrail:

1.  **Push to GitHub**: Ensure your project, including your latest changes, is pushed to a GitHub repository. **Important**: Make sure to commit the `package-lock.json` file as well, as Vercel uses it to install the exact dependency versions.

2.  **Import Project on Vercel**:
    -   Sign up for a free Vercel account and connect it to your GitHub.
    -   Click "Add New..." -> "Project".
    -   Select your CashTrail repository from the list.

3.  **Configure Project**:
    -   Vercel will automatically detect that you are using Vite and configure the build settings for you. You typically do not need to change anything here.
    -   The most important step is to add your Firebase environment variables. Go to the "Settings" tab of your new Vercel project, then click on "Environment Variables".
    -   Add each variable from your `.env.local` file. For example:
        -   **Name**: `VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY`, **Value**: `your_api_key_value`
        -   **Name**: `VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`, **Value**: `your_auth_domain_value`
        -   ...and so on for all the variables in `.env.example`.

4.  **Deploy**:
    -   Click the "Deploy" button. Vercel will build and deploy your application.
    -   Once complete, you will be given a public URL where you can access your live CashTrail application.
